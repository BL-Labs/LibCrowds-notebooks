    "# An Introduction to Analysing In the Spotlight Data Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to help you become more familiar with the data structures used to store [LibCrowds](https://www.libcrowds.com/)' results data, as well as introduce you to a key Python library that can be used to request, manipulate, analyse and, in later notebooks, visualise that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python library used here is called [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which provides access to high-performance data analysis tools via a relatively accessible Python interface. We will use the library to load all of our *In the Spotlight* results into a structure called a dataframe. A dataframe is a two-dimensional data structure, similar to a spreadsheet, that accepts many different kinds of input. As everything is stored in memory, rather than on disk, the only limitation to this type of data structure is going to be the amount of RAM installed on the computer. However, for any relatively modern computer this is unlikely to be an issue until we reach tens of millions of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by importing the pandas library."

    "## The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, our input for this notebook will be all of the results generated so far through the crowdsourcing projects presented on [*In the Spotlight*](https://www.libcrowds.com/collections/playbills). These results are stored as Web Annotations; a W3C standard used to make data more easily reusable online. The abstract from the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model) is presented below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Annotations are typically used to convey information about a resource or associations between resources. Simple examples include a comment or tag on a single web page or image, or a blog post about a news article.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The Web Annotation Data Model specification describes a structured model and format to enable annotations to be shared and reused across different hardware and software platforms. Common use cases can be modeled in a manner that is simple and convenient, while at the same time enabling more complex requirements, including linking arbitrary content to a particular data point or to segments of timed multimedia resources.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The specification provides a specific JSON format for ease of creation and consumption of annotations based on the conceptual model that accommodates these use cases, and the vocabulary of terms that represents it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this standardised structure for our final results we aim to make the crowdsourced data generated via the platform more easily reusable online, providing ways for researchers to answer specific questions via programmatic means.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as the results data, we use Web Annotations to store additional user-generated data, such as image tags. All of these annotations are available via a public API, which also complies with a [standardised protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/). By using the API we can gain programmatic access to our current results data. Depending on the objective, this method of consuming and analysing the data is likely to present clear advantages when compared with performing similar visualisations using offline datasets (i.e. those downloaded to your computer). Importantly, data requested via the api will always be up-to-date; very soon after a task is completed the contributions will be analysed and the result made available via the API. For ongoing projects, offline datasets are by their nature out-of-date the minute you download them."

    "The LibCrowds Web Annotation API is available at the following location:\n",

    "\n",
    "Again, results are returned in containers where each key has some semantic meaning. To avoid overloading this notebook with new concepts (perhaps it's too late), we won't go into the meaning of these keys. For now, it is enough to understand that there are programmatic ways to navigate a collection of annotations and pull out the data required.\n",
    "\n",

    "Further, depending on the aspect of the data that we are interested in, requesting the entire dataset may be a computationally inefficient. The API includes other endpoints that can be used to search for specific data, which may be explored in other notebooks. However, for the sake of simplicity, in this notebook we will simply load the entire dataset into a dataframe, before filtering out the parts that we don't need."
