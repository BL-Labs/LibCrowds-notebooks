    "# An Introduction to Analysing LibCrowds Results Data Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to introduce a key Python library, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), that can be used to manipulate and analyse LibCrowds results data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library provides access to high-performance data analysis tools via an accessible Python interface. We will use the library to load all of our *In the Spotlight* results into a structure called a dataframe. A dataframe is a two-dimensional data structure, similar to a spreadsheet, that accepts many different kinds of input. As everything is stored in memory, rather than on disk, the only limitation to this type of data structure is going to be the amount of RAM installed on the computer. However, for any modern computer this is unlikely to be an issue until we reach tens of millions of results.\n",

    "We begin by importing pandas."

    "For this notebook, our input will be all of the performance data collected so far via the crowdsourcing projects presented on [*In the Spotlight*](https://www.libcrowds.com/collections/playbills). In a previous notebook we saw how these results are modelled in their raw form. However, for the purposes of this notebook we have converted this raw data into a table of performances, where each row contains the known data for a specific performance (e.g. title, date, genre and theatre). The way in which this was achieved is slightly too complex to introduce here but for those interested the scripts can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/LibCrowds/data).\n",
